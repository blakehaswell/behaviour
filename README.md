Behaviour is a jQuery library for adding behaviours to elements while abstracting common boilerplate code.

An extremely basic example can be found in `/demo`.

This code has been heavily refactored, but the underlying concept was used in a production site that underwent significant testing. More unit testing and example code to come shortly.
